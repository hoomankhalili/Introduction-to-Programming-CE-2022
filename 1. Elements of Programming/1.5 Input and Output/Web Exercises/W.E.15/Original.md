**Spiraling mice.** Suppose that N mice that start on the vertices of a regular polygon with N sides, and they each head toward the nearest other mouse (in counterclockwise direction) until they all meet. Write a program to draw the logarithmic spiral paths that they trace out by drawing nested N-gons, rotated and shrunk as in [this animation](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Whirl.html).
