***Hitchhiker problem.*** You are interviewing N candidates for the sole position of American Idol. Every minute you get to see a new candidate, and you have one minute to decide whether or not to declare that person the American Idol. You may not change your mind once you finish interviewing the candidate. Suppose that you can immediately rate each candidate with a single real number between 0 and 1, but of course, you don't know the rating of the candidates not yet seen. Devise a strategy and write a program AmericanIdol that has at least a 25% chance of picking the best candidate (assuming the candidates arrive in random order), reading the 500 data values from standard input.
Solution: interview for N/2 minutes and record the rating of the best candidate seen so far. In the next N/2 minutes, pick the first candidate that has a higher rating than the recorded one. This yields at least a 25% chance since you will get the best candidate if the second best candidate arrives in the first N/2 minutes, and the best candidate arrives in the final N/2 minutes. This can be improved slightly to 1/e = 0.36788 by using essentially the same strategy, but switching over at time N/e.
