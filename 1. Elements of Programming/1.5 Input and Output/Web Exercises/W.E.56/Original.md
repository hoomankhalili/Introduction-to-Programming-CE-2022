Consider the Java program Ruler.java.
```java
public class Ruler { 
   public static void main(String[] args) { 
      int n = StdIn.readInt();
      String s = StdIn.readString();
      System.out.println((n+1) + " " + s + (n+1)  + s);
   }
}
```
Suppose that the file input.txt contains the integers 1 and 1. What does the following command do?

```java Ruler < input.txt | java Ruler | java Ruler | java Ruler```
