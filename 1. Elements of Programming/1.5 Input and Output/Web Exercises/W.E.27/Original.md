**Bresenham's line drawing algorithm.** To plot a line segment from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) on a monitor, say 1024-by-1024, you need to make a discrete approximation to the continuous line and determine exactly which pixels to turn on. [Bresenham's line drawing algorithm](http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/group/goa/mallinnus/lines/bresenh.html) is a clever solution that works when the slope is between 0 and 1 and x1 < x2.
