***Rotating table.*** You are seated at a rotating square table (like a lazy Susan), and there are four coins placed in the four corners of the table. Your goal is to flip the coins so that they are either all heads or all tails, at which point a bell rings to notify you that you are done. You may select any two of them, determine their orientation, and (optionally) flip either or both of them over. To make things challenging, you are blindfolded, and the table is spun after each time you select two coins. Write a program RotatingTable.java that initializes the coins to random orientations. Then, it prompts the user to select two positions (1-4), and identifies the orientation of each coin. Next, the user can specify which, if any of the two coins to flip. The process repeats until the user solves the puzzle.
