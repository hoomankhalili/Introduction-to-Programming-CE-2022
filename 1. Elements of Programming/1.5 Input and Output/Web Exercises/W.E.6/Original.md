**Print a random word.** Read a list of N words from standard input, where N is unknown ahead of time, and print out one of the N words uniformly at random. Do not store the word list. Instead, use Knuth's method: when reading in the ith word, select it with probability 1/i to be the selected word, replacing the previous champion. Print out the word that survives after reading in all of the data.
