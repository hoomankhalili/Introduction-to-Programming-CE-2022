Computer animation. In 1995 James Gosling presented a demonstration of Java to Sun executives, illustrating its potential to deliver dynamic and interactive Web content. At the time, web pages were fixed and non-interactive. To demonstrate what the Web could be, Gosling presented applets to rotate 3D molecules, visualize sorting routines, and Duke cart-wheeling across the screen. Java was officially introduced in May 1995 and widely adopted in the technology sector. The Internet would never be the same.
