Write a program Closest.java that takes three floating-point command-line arguments $(x,y,z)$, reads from standard input a sequence of point coordinates $(x_i,y_i,z_i)$, and prints the coordinates of the point closest to $(x,y,z)$. Recall that the square of the distance between $(x,y,z)$ and $(x_i,y_i,z_i)$ is $(x−x_i)^2+(y−y_i)^2+(z−z_i)^2$. For efficiency, do not use Math.sqrt() or Math.pow().
