Write a program Rose.java that takes a command-line argument n and plots a rose with n petals (if n is odd) or 2n petals (if n is even) by plotting the polar coordinates $(r, θ)$ of the function $r = sin(n × θ)$ for $θ$ ranging from $0$ to $2π$ radians. Below is the desired output for n = 4, 7, and 8.
