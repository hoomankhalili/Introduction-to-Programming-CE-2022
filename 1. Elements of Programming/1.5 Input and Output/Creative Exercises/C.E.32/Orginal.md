**Clock.** Write a program Clock.java that displays an animation of the second, minute, and hour hands of an analog clock. Use the method StdDraw.show(1000) to update the display roughly once per second.

Hint: this may be one of the rare times when you want to use the % operator with a double - it works the way you would expect.
