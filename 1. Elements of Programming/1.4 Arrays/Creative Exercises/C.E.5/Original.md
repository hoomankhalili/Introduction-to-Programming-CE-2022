**Birthday problem.** Suppose that people enter an empty room until a pair of people share a birthday. On average, how many people will have to enter before there is a match? Write a program Birthday.java to simulate one experiment. Write a program Birthdays.java to repeat the experiment many times and estimate the average value. Assume birthdays to be uniform random integers between 0 and 364.
