**Random permutation.** Write a program Permutation.java so that it takes a command-line argument N and prints a random permutation of the integers 0 through N-1. Also print a checkerboard visualization of the permutation. As an example, the permutation { 4, 1, 3, 0, 2 } corresponds to:
````
4 1 3 0 2
* * * Q * 
* Q * * * 
* * * * Q 
* * Q * * 
Q * * * * 
````
