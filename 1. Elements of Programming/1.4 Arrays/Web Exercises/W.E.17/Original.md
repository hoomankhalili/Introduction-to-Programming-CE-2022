***Borda count.*** In 1781, Borda proposed a positional method for determining the outcome of a political election with K voters and N candidates. Each voter ranks the candidates in increasing order of preference (from 1 to N). Borda's method assigns a score to each candidate equal to the sum of their rankings. The candidate with the highest sum wins. This is used in Major League Baseball to determine the MVP.
