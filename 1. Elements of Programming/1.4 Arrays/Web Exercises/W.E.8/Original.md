***Scheduling with deadline.*** Suppose that you have N tasks to schedule. Each task takes 1 unit of time and has a deadline by which time it is expected to finish. If a task is not completed by its deadline, you pay a $1,000 fine. Find a schedule that minimizes the penalty. Hint: schedule the tasks in order of their deadline, but don't bother with any task that won't finish by its deadline.
