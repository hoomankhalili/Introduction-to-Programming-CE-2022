***Blackjack.*** Write a program Blackjack.java that takes three command line integers x, y, and z representing your two blackjack cards x and y, and the dealer's face-up card z, and prints the "standard strategy" for a 6 card deck in Atlantic city. Assume that x, y, and z are integers between 1 and 10, representing an ace through a face card. Report whether the player should hit, stand, or split according to these(http://www.blackjackinfo.com/cgi-bin/bjbse.cgi?game=ac6) strategy tables. Encode the strategy tables using three 2-D boolean arrays.
Modify Blackjack.java to allow doubling.
