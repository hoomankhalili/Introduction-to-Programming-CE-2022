**Blackjack.** Write a program Blackjack.java that takes three command line integers x, y, and z representing your two blackjack cards x and y, 
and the dealers face-up card z, and prints the "standard strategy" for a 6 card deck in Atlantic city. 
Assume that x, y, and z are integers between 1 and 10, representing an ace through a face card. Report whether the player should hit, stand, or split according to
these [strategy tables](https://www.blackjackinfo.com/). (When you learn about arrays, you will encounter an alternate strategy that does not involve as many if-else statements).
