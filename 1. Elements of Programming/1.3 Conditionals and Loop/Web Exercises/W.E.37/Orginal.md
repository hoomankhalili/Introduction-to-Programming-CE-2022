Program [Binary.java](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/13flow/Binary.java.html) prints the binary representation of a decimal number n by casting out powers of 2. Write an alternate version Program Binary2.java that is based on the following method: Write 1 if n is odd, 0 if n is even. Divide n by 2, throwing away the remainder. Repeat until n = 0 and read the answer backwards. Use % to determine whether n is even, and use string concatenation to form the answer in reverse order.
