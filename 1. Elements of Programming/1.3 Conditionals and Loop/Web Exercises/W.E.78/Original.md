**Body mass index.** The body mass index (BMI) is the ratio of the weight of a person (in kilograms) to the square of the height (in meters). Write a program BMI.java that takes two command-line arguments, weight and height, computes the BMI, and prints the corresponding BMI category:
Starvation: less than 15
Anorexic: less than 17.5
Underweight: less than 18.5
Ideal: greater than or equal to 18.5 but less than 25
Overweight: greater than or equal to 25 but less than 30
Obese: greater than or equal to 30 but less than 40
Morbidly Obese: greater than or equal to 40
