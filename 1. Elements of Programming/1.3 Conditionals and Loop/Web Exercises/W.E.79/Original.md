**Reynolds number.** The Reynolds number is the ratio if inertial forces to viscous forces and is an important quantity in fluid dynamics.
Write a program that takes in 4 command-line arguments, the diameter d, the velocity v, the density rho, and the viscosity mu, and 
prints the Reynold's number d * v * rho / mu (assuming all arguments are in SI units). If the Reynold's number is less than 2000, print laminar flow,
if it's between 2000 and 4000, print transient flow, and if it's more than 4000, print turbulent flow.
