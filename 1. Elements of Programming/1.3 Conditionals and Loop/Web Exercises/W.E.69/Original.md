**Weather balloon.** (Etter and Ingber, p. 123) Suppose that h(t) = 0.12t4 + 12t3 - 380t2 + 4100t + 220 represents the height of a weather balloon at time t 
(measured in hours) for the first 48 hours after its launch. Create a table of the height at time t for t = 0 to 48. What is its maximum height?
