Rewrite **TenHellos.java** to make a program **Hellos.java** that takes the number of lines to print as a command-line argument. You may assume that the argument is less than 1000. Hint: consider using i % 10 and i % 100 to determine whether to use "st", "nd", "rd", or "th" for printing the ith Hello.
