Write a program Hurricane.java that that takes the wind speed (in miles per hour) as an integer command-line argument and prints whether it qualifies as a hurricane, and if so, whether it is a Category 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 hurricane. Below is a table of the wind speeds according to the [Saffir-Simpson scale](https://www.marinewaypoints.com/marine/wind.shtml).


|Category |	Wind Speed (mph)|
|---------|-----------------|
|1        |	74 - 95         |
|2        |	96 - 110        |
|3   	    |	111 - 130       |
|4   	    |	131 - 155       |
|5   	    |	155 and above   |
