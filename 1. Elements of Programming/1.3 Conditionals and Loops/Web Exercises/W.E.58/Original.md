```Euler's sum of powers conjecture.``` In 1769 Euler generalized Fermat's Last Theorem and conjectured that it is impossible to find three 4th powers whose sum is a 4th power, or four 5th powers whose sum is a 5th power, etc. The conjecture was disproved in 1966 by exhaustive computer search. Disprove the conjecture by finding positive integers a, b, c, d, and e such that a5 + b5 + c5 + d5= e5. Write a program Euler.java that reads in a command line parameter N and exhaustively searches for all such solutions with a, b, c, d, and e less than or equal to N. No counterexamples are known for powers greater than 5, but you can join EulerNet, a distributed computing effort to find a counterexample for sixth powers.
