**Decimal expansion of rational numbers.** Given two integers p and q, the decimal expansion of p/q has an infinitely repeating cycle. For example, 1/33 = 0.03030303.... We use the notation 0.(03) to denote that 03 repeats indefinitely. As another example, 8639/70000 = 0.1234(142857). Write a program DecimalExpansion.java that reads in two command line integers p and q and prints the decimal expansion of p/q using the above notation. Hint: use Floyd's rule.
