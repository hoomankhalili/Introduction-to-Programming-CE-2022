**Body mass index.** The [body mass index (BMI)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index) is the ratio of the weight of a person (in kilograms) to the square of the height (in meters). Write a program BMI.java that takes two command-line arguments, weight and height, computes the BMI, and prints the corresponding BMI category:       
         
•Starvation: less than 15        
•Anorexic: less than 17.5       
•Underweight: less than 18.5       
•Ideal: greater than or equal to 18.5 but less than 25           
•Overweight: greater than or equal to 25 but less than 30          
•Obese: greater than or equal to 30 but less than 40           
•Morbidly Obese: greater than or equal to 40
